# NetBayesABM

**Agent-based models of plantâ€“pollinator networks with Bayesian inference (ABC).**

NetBayesABM is a Python library for simulating agent-based models (ABMs) of ecological networks, focusing on plantâ€“pollinator interactions. It provides tools to:

- Initialize agents (plants and pollinators) with different spatial configurations.  
- Construct and evolve bipartite networks dynamically.  
- Define and sample prior distributions (Gamma, Exponential) for interaction parameters.  
- Visualize abundances, priors, networks, and degree distributions.  
- Evaluate simulated networks against empirical data using multiple metrics.
