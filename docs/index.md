# NetBayesABM

NetBayesABM is a Python library for simulating agent-based models (ABMs) of
plantâ€“pollinator networks with Bayesian inference (ABC).

## Features
- Initialize agents (plants, pollinators) with different spatial strategies.
- Build and evolve bipartite plantâ€“pollinator networks.
- Visualize abundances, priors, and degree distributions.
- Evaluate model vs empirical data using multiple metrics.
